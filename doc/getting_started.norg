  Get ready to experience a Neovim setup that just works, without all the hassle. Let‚Äôs get you set up, fast and easy!

* Configuring Fastvim
  
FastVim has two interesting configurable features: seamless theme switching and the File Starter module. Both are simple to configure and give you control over the behavior of your editor. Let‚Äôs explore both options!

Configuration directory
FastVim uses a dedicated directory for configurations, and its location depends on your operating system:

  - Linux: `~/.fast.d/`
  - Windows: `%AppData%\\.fast.d\\` (this points to the Roaming directory).
Make sure this directory exists before proceeding.

Configuring theme switching
Customize the look of your editor by easily switching themes.

Open your operating system‚Äôs configuration directory.
Inside .fast.d, make sure there is an init.lua file (create it if necessary).

Add this line to set your desired theme:

@code lua
vim.g.define_colorscheme("themename")
@end

Replace "themename" with your desired theme, such as "gruvbox":

@code lua
vim.g.define_colorscheme("gruvbox")
@end

Managing the File Starter module:
The File Starter module is disabled by default, automatically creating Java class files. If performance is your priority, you can enable it.

In the same init.lua file, add the following line to enable the module:
@code lua
vim.g.auto_create_java_class = true
@end

The FastVim loader will automatically parse the init.lua file in your configuration directory and apply all the settings during Neovim startup. No extra steps are necessary ‚Äî just set your preferences and they will take effect.

Why configure these features?
Theme Switcher: Customize your editor with styles that match your taste, whether vibrant or minimalist.
File starter: Saves you time by automatically creating a class when opening an empty Java file.

This setup ensures flexibility while maintaining simplicity in configuration.
