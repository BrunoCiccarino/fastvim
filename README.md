Welcome to Fastvim, the next-gen Neovim distro that‚Äôs fast, modern, and totally configurable. Built for lazy folks who don‚Äôt want to mess with endless configs, and for the Neovim Martian üëΩ hackers who want total control over their setup. Whether you just want things to work out of the box or you love tweaking every little detail, Fastvim‚Äôs got your back.

Forget about spending hours setting up your Neovim environment. With Fastvim, you can get started right away, but if you're into customization, it's as flexible as you need it to be. This distro has everything you need for a smooth, efficient workflow, and if you're feeling adventurous, you can dive in and make it your own.

Get ready to experience a Neovim setup that just works, without all the fluff. Let‚Äôs get you set up, quick and easy!

## üí§ Installation

#### linux or mac

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastvim/fastvim.git ~/.config/nvim 
cd .config/nvim
./install.sh
```
#### Windows

- powershell

```ps1
iex (iwr -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastvim/fastvim/main/install.ps1)
```

- cmd

```
powershell -Command "iex (iwr -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastvim/fastvim/main/install.ps1)"
```
### üíª Setup

For the distro to work as expected, we need to configure a few things, let's start by downloading the lsp(language server protocol) that you will use by installing with mason

To do this you type: `MasonInstall LspName`

Ex: 

```
:MasonInstall clangd
```
Or if you are java dev 

```
MasonInstall jdtls
```

Lsp (language server protocol) bring you countless benefits when coding, such as auto completions, syntactic error warnings in real time, and for this we have some plugins like [nvim-cmp](), for snippets we have [ luasnip]() that works exceptionally well and we have mini.pairs to autocomplete special characters like [], (), <>, etc...

receive real-time error diagnosis

![lint](./img/fastlint.jpg)

With the setup complete, you're now ready to dive into using your new Neovim IDE. Let's get started!

### Quickstart

Now that everything is set up, let's jump into using FastVim. Follow these steps to start coding efficiently:

Open Neovim
Launch Neovim by running:

```bash
nvim
```
Explore the Dashboard
Upon starting Neovim, you'll see a customizable dashboard. Use it to quickly open recent files, create new projects, or access settings.

Install Plugins
Ensure all required plugins are installed by running:

```bash
:Lazy
```
This will display the plugin manager. Press u to update all plugins.

Set Up LSP
If you haven't installed your language server yet, use Mason:

```bash
:MasonInstall <LspName>
```
Replace <LspName> with the appropriate server for your language (e.g., clangd for C/C++, jdtls for Java).

Start Coding
Open a file or create a new one:

```bash
nvim myfile.<extension>
```
Replace <extension> with the file type you're working with (e.g., java, go, sql). Autocompletions, syntax highlighting, and LSP features will be ready to assist you.

**update distro**

To update the distro you have two options, `:FastUpdate` which will update the distro to the latest version, and `:FastStable` which will update the distro to the latest stable version (recommended)

**Explore Keymaps**
This configuration comes with pre-mapped keys for common actions. Check the keybindings guide by pressing:

```bash
:help keymaps
```
You're now ready to enjoy a complete IDE experience with FastVim!

#### üó∫Ô∏è keymaps

To make your workflow much more fluid, we created countless keyboard shortcuts both to use the incredible plugins and to move around neovim in a faster and more efficient way.
